        I would just like to say thank you for this wonderful course. I have 
        learned so much from doing this course over the past months and it has
        made me a better programmer.
        As for feedback, the only thing I can say is that Part II of the course
        needs to be rewritten as there were time when instructions were not
        clear enough.
        I do hope you continue in updating this amazing course as it will
        undoubtedly help many more.
        Thanks again for everything.
